KSP-StockPlus
=========================

Small additions to the game.


Installation
============
Unzip the zip file to the KSP/GameData directory. ModuleManager.X.X.X.dll should be in the root GameData directory next to a StockPlus folder.

The additions are all stand alone. So if there are any that you don't want, just delete the directory inside the StockPlus folder.
